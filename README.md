# NLP-textual-entailment
A simple model made using LSTM in tensorflow. In its current state, the model is not very efficient since only a small part of the SNLI dataset was used to train it. I will try to improve it in the future. It only has an accuracy of about 0.5.
There is a small bug that occurs due to the tensorflow version from time to time where a line of code shows an error. Re-excecution of the same code does not give the same error. I have attached a few screenshots with various test cases.
